A board screen for terminals 

## Notes 

I am planning a fifteen entry per screen, with the following fields :
Company, Destination, Time, Gate (Plataforma / Andene) . 


Optional fields : Estimated Time, Status (delays), Remarks (Observação / Observacion) 

Also a way to interrupt with ads or informational things. Maybe some way to let it be stream /piped to something else.
