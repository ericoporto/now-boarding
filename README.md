A board screen for terminals 

## Notes 

I am planning a fifteen entry per screen, with the following fields :
Company, Destination, Time, Gate (Plataforma / Andene),  Status (delays) . 
,

Optional fields : Estimated Time, Remarks (Observação / Observacion) 

Also a way to interrupt with ads or informational things. Maybe some way to let it be stream /piped to something else.
